🏠 Airbnb Open Data EDA
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Airbnb Open Data, performed using a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis aims to uncover key market trends, price drivers, supply hotspots, and demand patterns.

🎯 Key Objectives
Market Structure: Analyze the distribution of listings by room_type and neighbourhood.

Price Dynamics: Investigate the distribution of listing price and identify factors influencing it.

Demand Analysis: Use number_of_reviews as a proxy for demand to identify popular listings and areas.

Geospatial Insights: Visualize listings geographically to spot high-price and high-density clusters.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas (Data manipulation), matplotlib & seaborn (Data visualization)

📊 Key Visualizations
The analysis includes several plots essential for understanding the dataset:

Distribution of Price (Log-Transformed): To visualize price central tendency and skewness.

Listing Count by Room Type: To show supply breakdown.

Price Distribution by Neighbourhood Group (Box Plot): To compare price variations across major areas.

Correlation Heatmap: To identify linear relationships between numerical features.
